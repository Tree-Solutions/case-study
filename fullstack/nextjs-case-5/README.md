# Full Stack Middle Developer Case Study

Hi and thank you for participating in this case study of **Tree Solutions**! We're excited to see how you approach building a full-stack application from scratch while showcasing your skills with modern web development tools.

This case study focuses on building a **multi-step property form** with a **portfolio overview** page that stores and retrieves data from a **PostgreSQL database hosted on Vercel**. Below are the detailed requirements and expectations for this assignment.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Next.js (App Router)**  

- **TypeScript**  

- **Prisma** + **PostgreSQL**  

- **React Hook Form** + **Zod**  

- **React Query**  

- **TailwindCSS** + **Shadcn UI**  

- **Vercel**  

---

## üìã What You'll Be Building

The application consists of:

1. **A Multi-Step Wizard**:
   - **Step 1: Property Details**  
     - Collect basic property information like name, address, and close date.
     - Validation should include error messages (e.g., required fields, invalid formats).
   - **Step 2: Rent Roll**  
     - Display or seed data for tenants/units.
     - Provide an interface to browse this data (pagination optional).
   - **Step 3: Financing**  
     - Start with a single "Debt 1" form, and allow users to add up to 10 additional debts using tabs.
     - Each tab should have its own fields (e.g., lender name, loan amount, interest rate).
   - **Step 4: Income & Expenses**  
     - Input fields for incomes and expenses (e.g., net rental, utilities, property taxes).
     - **Real-time calculations** for:
       - **(EGI)** Effective Gross Income
       - **Total Expenses**
       - **Net Operating Income (NOI)**
   - **Step 5: Ownership Structure**  
     - Default three owners (Name + Ownership Percentage) with validation.
     - Allow adding additional owners dynamically.

2. **A Portfolio Overview Page**:
   - Displays all properties submitted through the wizard in a clean, card-based layout.
   - Each card should include:
     - Property Name and Address
     - Key financial metrics (e.g., Asset Value, LTV, DSCR, NOI, Rent per sqft, Expense Ratio)
     - Summary information for easy review.

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements

### 1. **Form Handling**
- Use **React Hook Form** for form management and state handling.
- Use **Zod** for validation schemas and display **clear error messages** for invalid inputs.

### 2. **UI Design**
- Use **Shadcn UI** components for the entire interface.
- Use **TailwindCSS** for layout and styling.
- While the provided [Figma design](https://www.figma.com/design/ihr175BRpZX3eX7K3YhFdG/Test_Test-Tree_Solutions?node-id=1-10264&t=SzdtaG3HiD6Xt8V7-4) serves as a **reference**, you are not required to match it pixel-perfectly. Focus on creating a clean and functional UI.

### 3. **Database Integration**
- Use **Prisma** to define schemas and manage data for all steps of the wizard.
- Store data in a **PostgreSQL database hosted on Vercel**.
- Ensure the schema supports:
  - Properties with related data for financing, rent rolls, and ownership.
  - Financial metrics like expenses and income.

### 4. **Backend & API**
- Build backend API routes using **Next.js**.
- Use **React Query** to fetch and mutate data between the frontend and backend.

### 5. **Deployment**
- Deploy the application to **Vercel**.
- Use Vercel‚Äôs PostgreSQL for the production database and set the appropriate `DATABASE_URL` environment variable.

## üßÆ Key Calculations

The following calculations must be implemented for the **Income & Expenses** step and the **Portfolio Overview** page. Ensure these values are computed in real-time where applicable.

1. **Effective Gross Income (EGI)**  
   `EGI = Net Rental + Retail Income + Insurance Income + Misc Additional Income`
2. **Total Expenses**  
   `Total Expenses = Property Taxes + Insurance + Utilities + Repairs & Maintenance + Miscellaneous`
3. **Net Operating Income (NOI)**  
   `NOI = EGI - Total Expenses`
4. **Asset Value**  
   `Asset Value = NOI / Cap Rate`
   - Use a fixed Cap Rate of 5% (0.05).
5. **LTV (Loan-to-Value)**  
   `LTV (%) = (Total Debt / Asset Value) * 100`
6. **DSCR (Debt Service Coverage Ratio)**  
   `DSCR = NOI / Annual Debt Service`
7. **Rent per sqft**  
   `Rent per sqft = Net Rental / Total Square Footage`
8. **Expense Ratio**  
   `Expense Ratio (%) = (Total Expenses / EGI) * 100`
